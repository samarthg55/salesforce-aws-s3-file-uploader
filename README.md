# Salesforce to AWS S3 File Uploader

This project demonstrates a full-stack integration between **Salesforce** and **Amazon S3**, enabling secure file uploads from a **Lightning Web Component (LWC)** directly into an S3 bucket using **pre-signed URLs** generated by **AWS Lambda**.

---

## Architecture
Salesforce LWC → Apex → API Gateway → Lambda → Pre-Signed S3 URL → File Upload



-  Files are uploaded directly from the browser to S3 (no intermediate storage in Salesforce)
-  Lambda signs the upload URL with content-type and expiry
-  No AWS credentials are exposed

## Tech Stack

| Platform     | Technology                           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| Salesforce   | Apex, Lightning Web Components (LWC) |
| AWS          | S3, Lambda (Python), API Gateway, IAM|
| Frontend     | HTML, JavaScript (fetch API)         |

## Why Pre-Signed URLs?

Pre-signed URLs allow temporary, secure, and permissioned access to a specific S3 resource. This pattern allows Salesforce users to upload directly to S3 **without exposing AWS credentials or routing through Salesforce servers.**
